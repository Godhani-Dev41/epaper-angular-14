      "text": "US Boomers 2019: 'Aging in Place' in Multiple Aspects of Life Get link January 17, 2020\nAt Business Insider Intelligence, our mission is to bring you the most important insights, data and analysis from the digital world. So when we come across outstanding research from our partners that we think our audience can benefit from, we like to make sure you hear about it. That's why we're giving you a preview of eMarketer's new report: US Boomers 2019. You can purchase and download the full report here. Social media has become a hub of influence on many consumers' shopping. Boomers, though, have been wary of this, whether via ads, postings by fellow consumers or the cajolery of \"influencers.\"\nAccording to February 2019 polling by Oracle, social media ads inspire little credence from boomers. Fewer than one in 10 internet users ages 55 to 75 said they trust social ads for recommendations when shopping.\n\"It's not just an aversion to straight-out advertising. Influencers are conspicuously uninfluential, too,\" said Mark Dolliver, principal analyst at eMarketer and author of eMarketer's latest report, US Boomers 2019: 'Aging in Place' in Multiple Aspects of Life .",

      "text": "Disney is scrubbing the word 'Fox' from 20th Century Fox, chipping away at Rupert Murdoch's legacy Get link January 17, 2020\n20th Century Fox/Business Insider Disney removed the word \"Fox\" from the name of the famed 20th Century Fox movie studio, Variety magazine reported Friday. The studio will now be known as 20th Century Studios, multiple outlets confirmed. Changing the name appears to be a conscious effort to distance the studio from Rupert Murdoch, who sold it to Disney in early 2019. In recent years, Murdoch has shed vast swathes of his media empire, which is now focused on the Fox News cable network and a stable of influential newspapers.",

      "text": "Trump's defense team in his Senate impeachment trial will include Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr Get link January 17, 2020\nReuters/Andrew Innerarity President Donald Trump has put the final touches on his legal defense team before oral arguments in his Senate impeachment trial kick off on Tuesday. Trump's defense will include the attorneys Alan Dershowitz, Ken Starr, and Robert Ray. Starr and Ray both investigated President Bill Clinton during his impeachment in the 1990s. The team will be led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump's personal defense attorney, Jay Sekulow. It also includes former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi. Dershowitz later seemed to distance himself from claims, most of which he himself made, that he would be a full-time member of the defense team, telling Mediaite, \"I will be there for one hour, basically, presenting my argument. But I'm not a full-fledged member of the defense team in any realistic sense of that term.\" Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories .\nPresident Donald Trump has put together his legal defense team before oral arguments in his Senate impeachment trial kick off on Tuesday.\nThe upper chamber officially opened its trial on Thursday and senators were sworn in even as new evidence against the president continued spilling out into the public. On Friday, the White House released a full list of the defense team, which again asserted that \"President Trump has done nothing wrong.\"\nNOW WATCH: Extremists turned a frog meme into a hate symbol, but Hong Kong protesters revived it as an emblem of hope\nSee Also:",

      "text": "THE SOCIAL COMMERCE REPORT: Inside the fast-developing opportunity to reach billions of consumers' wallets using social platforms Get link January 17, 2020\nThis is a preview of THE SOCIAL COMMERCE REPORT from Business Insider Intelligence. 14-Day Risk Free Trial: Get full access to this and all Payments & Commerce industry research reports. Social media's immense popularity and influence have built a huge potential audience for shopping through social platforms. Global internet users spent an average of 142 minutes per day on social media in 2018, up from 90 minutes in 2012, according to a report from GlobalWebIndex cited by Digital Information World.\nThis has made social media a major influence on consumers' purchasing habits, with 36% of US internet users saying social networks have become as important as other information sources for making product choices, up from 27% in 2015, according to a survey from GfK cited by eMarketer.\nAs social media's influence grows, social commerce is becoming an increasingly important channel in online shopping. Consumers have used social media to learn about products and brands and find inspiration for over a decade; the term \"social commerce\" was introduced by Yahoo! in 2005. But in the past few years, platforms have been working to eliminate the friction of buying a product elsewhere after discovering it on social media by adding buy buttons and digital wallets, for instance, so users can make direct purchases.",

      "text": "Tommy Lee Sparta Delivers “Hard Ears” Video, Watch It January 18, 2020, 10:48 pm 15k Views 14 SHARES\nTommy Lee Sparta dropped the audio for “Hard Ears” simply over a month earlier, and now we have the visuals to finish the whole bundle.\nBefore delving into the contents of the video, Tommy Lee Sparta needs to be praised as one of the most constant skills in business. He has actually had an amazing 2019, launching several songs with numerous getting constant rotations in the house and abroad. “Hard Ears” sees Tommy relating to Montego Bay-based manufacturer TipGod, and it appears it is the very first authorities track in between the 2. Tommy does the track justice and brings his design to the leading edge.\nTommy’s tone plays, and singing modifications are constantly happily unexpected. He shows his skill all through the track, nevertheless, he actually gets into it to the end, changing from singing to a moderate chant prior to resuming singing. Much like all of Tommy’s current track, this one likewise has Boss Lady Muzik’s hands all over it. Maybe that is the secret sauce to his current success and constant video releases.\nThe video of “Hard Ears” opens with the Boss Lady logo design prior to leaping to a shot of Tommy deejaying in front of a mirror. The video has numerous scenes that make you go hmmm, based upon the violent insinuations in a few of the scenes. With shots such as a guy lighting a blowtorch while somebody is connected to a tree or the images of a guy wielding a machete leaves a great deal of gray locations for the mind to question what occurs next, certainly getting the blood pumping. We have Pixl Edge Studio to thank for the shots. They likewise recorded visuals for among his more current videos, “Under Vibes.”\nTommy Lee appears prepared for 2020, and with Boss Lady Muzik at the helm of things, it might be an extremely satisfying year.",

      "text": "\nOnce, and for a long time, there was a public elementary school in Peninsula, across the street from the post office. For the most part, they rubbed along, amicably. How could they not, you ask? Well, parents of elementary students sometimes had as much self-control as their children, and thought nothing of commandeering the post office parking lot for important events in the lives of their children, like Christmas concerts, spring graduations, spring concerts, grandparent lunch days, and so forth and so on.\nPosting notices to please not use the post office lot for overflow parking did not work; on the whole these parents seemed not to use the post office. So Sue, the Postmaster, took to posting signs outside. Eventually they had to include the threat of ticketing and towing, but grammar school parents learned to parallel park on the adjacent street, and taxpayers could again use the post office.\nThen the school district completed its jillion dollar plan, and moved the elementary school to the educational campus on the old Quick Orchard. The building did not stay empty, no indeed. The elementary school building was sold to the Cuyahoga Valley Christian Academy, which opened the Heritage Classical Academy, preschool through sixth grade.\nThe Academy opened a year ago. A year ago I seldom used the post office, so the resurgence of rude behavior went unnoticed by me. Until a recent Monday. I played cards, from one to three. I did not go home; I continued on to the post office, with towels to mail. I turned from Riverview to Bronson, to a dead halt in a line of traffic to turn into the school, two blocks away. Not to worry; they would not block the entrance to the post office, I decided, and proceeded cautiously up the hill.\nWell, yes they would! I “double stopped” next to the car behind the post office drive. When the blockage car cleared, that car surely would notice my right turn blinker and let me in. Wrong. She pulled up to block the drive. I pulled beside her, rolled down my passenger window, to let out maximum noise, and blew the horn loudly. Eventually she cautiously glanced over. I extended my left index finger and stroked it a few times with the right. Surely any elementary school parent recognized the universal “Shame On You” notation. She looked away.\nI made as much engine and brake noise as possible in half a block, turned right onto Emerson and right into the post office exit. I said to the nice young man, in the slew of turnover since Postmaster Sue, “Is your drive often blocked by parents at pick up time?”\n“Oh, yes. They do it all the time.”\n“You need a ‘Do Not Block Drive’ sign,” said I. “I’ll call the mayor.” And I came home.\nI was barely in the door and my phone rang, with a call from a Restricted Number. I wonder how they do that?\nThe caller identified himself as The Mayor. “My god, that got through town awfully fast!” said I.\nThe Mayor said he actually wanted to talk business with me, but was mighty curious about what went through town so fast. I explained the rude young parent problem; he promised to bring up the sign to the Planning Commission, and now, he would like to ask me if I would be interested in the position of Fiscal Officer. And I told him, had he asked me last June, when I was casting about for something meaningful to do again, I very likely would have told him “Yes.”\n“But now, I have a job I like very much.”\nOh, the irony. I was the township fiscal officer for thirteen years, until the accident in DC. What goes around does not always come around. Hopefully excepting curing elementary school parents of rudeness.\n",

(They were hiding behind me but are both very loud and Labrador is very big). Text the neighbours to let them know to go and check their tool shed as the DH has all of his business tools in it and his van.\nWe had had someone come and unlock our gate a while before and both dogs had escaped onto the road. There had been lots of Facebook posts about thefts of pedigrees and we thought someone might have been hanging around to steal them but they just went running to the bins over the road 🤦🏻‍♀️. We changed our back gate after that and it’s more secure.",

Yesterday news broke validating our speculations that the Bajan pop star and her sweetheart Hassan Jameel have actually separated. We’re informed that the set have actually been separated for months, which suggests that RiRi was single for a while prior to she began talking to Rocky around the start of December. “They’ve been dating since the start of December they’re just good at keeping it under wraps,” a source inside the Bajan pop star’s circle informed Urban Islandz late Friday night.\nAs to the reason that Rihanna and Jameel separated, we’re informed that the relationship was tough to preserve due to the fact that of their very hectic schedule. “Believe it or not they argue a lot about it, RiRi is super busy, she hardly even have time to go into the studio and he is very busy too running multiple businesses,” sources stated. “It’s like one of those love stories that you want to root for but deep down you knew it was doomed from the start. All of us are surprised it lasted that long, just wasn’t sustainable.”\nBase on what we’re informed, Rihanna has actually been single considering that completion of summer season in 2015. She and A$AP Rocky have actually been buddies for many years and preserved contact with each other even while she was dating Jameel. We’re informed that the folks in Rihanna’s circle like A$AP a lot and like spending time him. “His vibe is good man, he’s a good guy very funny and down to earth man everyone around her like them together he’s dope,” our source exposed.\nRihanna was found at A$AP Rocky’s performance in Sweden back in December. They were likewise found out in London having supper on 2 events in December. In case you still question that anything is occurring in between them, RiRi was at the Yams Day advantage performance in Brooklyn last night supporting her guy. Interestingly Drake was likewise at the program and in the very same VIP area, however they weren’t connecting with each other. From the intel we’re getting, they have actually been investing method more time together than we know, they’ve simply handled to keep things under covers.\nSince finding out about her single status, Boosie Badazz has actually been shooting his shot on the Gram. As for Drake, it’s uncertain if he attempted to make a relocation yet, however Rihanna was found at his birthday celebration at a club in Los Angeles in October.",

Purchase this report. 14-Day Risk Free Trial: Get full access to this and all Connectivity & Tech research reports. In the face of rising demand for data, increasingly saturated mobile markets, and stiff opposition from legacy players, tech entrants, and startups, global telecoms are locked in a battle for market share. These market pressures have led to vicious price wars for mobile services and, as a result, declining average revenue per user (ARPU). Making matters worse, improvements in infrastructure and technology have made telecoms largely comparable in terms of coverage, connection speeds, and service pricing, meaning companies must transform their businesses if they hope to compete. For many global telecoms, shoring up market share under today's pressures while also future-proofing operations means having to invest in AI. The telecom industry is expected to invest $36.7 billion annually in AI software, hardware, and services by 2025, according to Tractica.",

      "text": "Masterlist | Feedback\n“You’ll never guess who I saw at the bar last night,” one of the assistants in the office nudged you in the copy room. He barely even waited a moment before he eagerly continued. “That junior pain in the ass from Price a few years ago! What was his name?”\nJaehyun .\n“Jung?” The assistant prattled on, “Jae, something-or-other? God, what a prick. I wonder what he’s doing back in town.”\nWhat was Jaehyun doing back in town? How come he hadn’t made his usual point of making you painfully aware of it?\nWhy were you so concerned about it?\nIt had been months since that night Jaehyun spooked Mark out of your apartment and made sure you hadn’t forgotten about him. You excused yourself from your babbling co-worker and drifted back to your desk with your finished copies, your mind awash with Jaehyun’s mysterious return to town. He was sure to show up at any minute now. You seated yourself at your desk, pulling open a drawer to fish out some sticky notes to flag your copies with when you spied it: a creased business card from Price Law with Jaehyun’s name on it, his cell number penned on the back.\nJaehyun had been so deceivingly charming years ago, handing you that card when you were just a receptionist and he was just an assistant at Price, trying for an interview at your firm for a position way out of his league. That was just like Jae — always swinging for the fences. He was going to be graduating soon and taking the bar exam not long after that, and he’d insisted on still trying for the associate position, even if just to get his name out there.\n“ I’m gonna be a big deal, you know ,” he’d grinned dashingly at you, even coming off a sizzling rejection upstairs, “ you’re going to be fielding calls from my office left and right in a few years. Maybe if you get to know me you can be the one making them .”\nThat was exactly how you remembered him: endlessly naive, endlessly cocky. You’d smiled like you knew better and took his business card, tossing it into your drawer without a glance. It then proceeded to get tossed into subsequent boxes as you moved from your reception desk, up the stairs to your assistant desk in your shared cubicle, to your paralegal desk in your personal cubicle. Just like the person attached to the card, you could never bring yourself to throw it out. starxreads\nThis series just keeps getting better and better! I love me some complicated relationships, and this one is a tangled mess  I just love these characters so much, how they push each other with their own need to have the last word. It’s not healthy, don’t get me wrong, but it’s still so interesting to read! That twist definitely made my stomach drop, and that ending tastes a lot like trouble. But if you know me, you know I love an open ending, and I love that bittersweet longing with a dash of Ariana Grande’s Almost Is Never Enough 蠟",

      "text": "19.01.2020\n5 Tips and hints on gambling house video games You Need To make sure you Employ Today\nNow i’m estimating what you’re every wondering now could be “An additional Booklet involved with Ra position, that’s exactly exactly what we need!&rdquo ;.Are When i best suited? Right, probably not. Since of course, Booklet from Ra is undoubtedly, unequivocally, some of the most cloned and also burned game inside the history of internet pai gow poker with 100 styles involved with extremely comparable slot machine at first circulated simply by Novomatic part, Greentube made use of throughout 2005. Nevertheless inferno, issues the harm with additional? Enter in Reserve about Ra Luxurious 10, produced simply by Greentube themselves on 18 th The fall of 2019.\nOf course, in the event that any kind of studio room has to get hold of worked the back of Course involving Ra it happens to be Greentube, is actually 10 E book with Ra slot machines today inside their assortment, they’ve certainly trained with an excellent go. The true challenge whilst is undoubtedly; is actually Novel in Ra Luxury 10 just one Ra just too many? Certainly, it’s possible that not… At this point, I’m not really heading to explode the following and then notify every body that slot could come to be since much loved since its widely known ancestor, that might be immensely wishful thinking. My business is, still, looking to imply the fact that at the minimum, Elegant 10 now calls for that structure within a better place and also could open up the fun connected with Ra completely to another audience. Whether or not it creates book of ra slot this change when the price for the existing fanbase is usually an issue really worth exploring seeing that well.\nThe best, rather considerable, distinction will be fishing reel mechanic. As well as its possible some 5×4 bobbin specify using 25 paylines instead of the quality 5×3 established although standing upright pretty pleased plus taller together with this is the moment lot of fly fishing reels 5 icons along and even 12 designs along introducing one other 75 paylines. You bet, that could be suitable, an important Ra slot machine with the help of a couple spool sets and then a coupled 100 paylines. Another, possibly even extra significant difference usually Elegant 10 is undoubtedly at many low/medium variance.\n‘Book’slots happen to be highly volatile affairs (although a lot of happen to be medium). They even usually tend use a 5,000x maximum win (although numerous really are 2,500x), in contrast to Luxury 10’s potential win is certainly 1,200x. You can still find main characteristics surely; that token and then design will always be extremely very similar not to mention the large captures will probably sourced from a zero cost revolves spherical by using a exceptional “broadening symbol&rdquo ;.But, there are actually other functions offered right that include switching wilds along with piled icons about the greater virginia reel set.\nCourse for Ra High quality 10 has a RTP with 95.

      "text": "On BBC 10 o'clock news I note it said that H&M will pay a commercial rent for Frogmore House when they stay there . It is disappointing that it will remain empty for most of the time and PC will pay for its upkeep. In the real world you pay a commercial rent for a home, irrespective of how little or often you occupy it. Still, that's PC's business as it is coming out of his own money.\nIt seems to me that H&M are the winners.They will have no royal duties, they get to keep the patronages and charities they are interested in and they'd already said they wished to give up the income from the sovereign grant. They are stlll going to receive funding from the Duchy of Cornwall so, apart from agreeing to\nuphold the monarchy's values, it sounds as if they have got what they wanted.\nThey may intend to pay back the £2.4m spent on Frogmore Cottage from taxpayers' money. I'll wait and see whether it actually happens.\nWe just need to know who will pay for securiy now.\nI hope Harry goes to Canada very soon and the UK press move on to the next story.",

      "text": "I think it's a bunch of hoopla. The late tyrant general was unloved by his own people - there were people dancing in the streets after his death. He was what any Mel Blanc character would have called a 'bad hombre'.\nA very salient reason I doubt they'll rev the ol' spinner basket up again is that non-volunteers are a drag on the services. They lower morale, sometimes on purpose, which leads to poor habits and dead personnel. Despite what people think, the military (any military) doesn't care for dead personnel. Optimum is to make the other side's personnel dead while keeping yours alive, leading us to drones.\nDrones have been striking and killing people on government orders for more than a decade. I agree with Tim Pool on this - the biggest danger to the US would be cyber-attacks on infrastructure - businesses and government websites. That can create havoc in the US, dissatisfaction, people rioting in the streets when their money or other necessities suddenly doesn't show up. The citizens would do the job of the foreign army while simultaneously tying the hands of the military because they aren't supposed to be attacking the civilians they're sworn to protect, and who might very well be their friends and family.\nSo, I think it's hoopla. I don't know why people want to scare others this way.",

      "text": "Transformational Leadership and Emotional Intelligence Posted Jan 18, 2020 TWEET\nI have always had an ongoing interest in leadership because strong leaders create strong organizations and in those organizations, the employees tend to emulate those strengths. When I first contemplated going back to school for a graduate degree, my initial thoughts were on pursuing a master’s in criminal justice, which I did, but nearly two years into the program, I switched over to the Master’s in Public Administration program and I never regretted that decision. Being fairly young and quite eager, I applied much of what I had learned “on-the-job” and in the graduate classroom to my position as an administrator for the Department of Corrections. prison Source: Michael Pittaro\nAt the time, most of the correctional leaders embraced a transactional leadership style since this was the style that I and most others were accustomed to working. In short, transactional leadership emphasizes results and staying within the existing structure of the organization. Transactional leaders operate under a system of rewards and punishments. Since the organizational structure of corrections is essentially quasi-military, this particular leadership style was the “go-to” style for up and coming correctional administrators.\nHowever, after nearly 15 years, I felt that the transactional approach to leadership was not the best approach. I was repeatedly told, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” a phrase I have grown to despise. The organizational structure of corrections might not have been broken, but it was most definitely not as effective as it could be in fulfilling its short and long-term mission and goals. I found my supervisors to be very close-minded, quite stubborn, and incredibly resistant to change, even if for the betterment of the prison, officers, and also the prisoners. I decided to leave corrections by accepting a position as the Executive Director of an outpatient drug and alcohol facility. While I had to report to a board of directors, I was given free reign to “lead” as I saw fit. This position enabled me to grow personally and professionally and it allowed me to “test the waters” with some of my ideas about transformational leadership. The lessons learned have been carried over into my career as a criminal justice professor and have been successful in the approach I have taken to teaching and relating to my students. corrections Source: Michael Pittaro\nAs part of my doctoral program, I had to successfully pass the university’s comprehensive exam, which I referred to as the beast. The dissertation, which followed, was referred to as Satan, but that is an entirely different story. Rather than regurgitate all that I learned within my doctoral program, I decided to take on a different approach to one of the exams questions, albeit riskier and somewhat controversial at the time, by challenging traditional wisdom . I went into it with the intention of critiquing the old authoritative, militaristic leadership style in favor of transformational leadership, a style that had been used successfully in the private sector for nearly two decades but was virtually nonexistent within the public safety sector.\nI easily identified with, and related to, the transformational approach because it focused more on motivating and inspiring employees rather than constantly threatening them with disciplinary action. To this day, I still believe that job satisfaction, morale, and performance will improve if you value, empower, and take a genuine interest in your employees, or in my current position, my students. Granted, disciplinary action is necessary from time to time, but I was looking for a change in antiquated basic assumptions by focusing more on the positive aspects of leading rather than on the negative. Long story short, the doctoral team that reviewed my response to this particular question on the exam provided glowing remarks. Student Source: Michael Pittaro\nIn 2014, I decided that I would now take it out of the academic arena by sharing my thoughts with criminal justice practitioners, namely correctional officers, and administrators. The initial article, Transformational leadership and the impact on morale and job satisfaction in corrections, was overwhelmingly supportive and reassuring by those who read and shared the publication. Of course, there were the typical haters and social media trolls, but the overwhelming majority enjoyed the article. Those that criticized the article could not articulate why they disagreed, but just that they disagreed, so their comments did not merit a response. This initial publication led to subsequent publications, podcasts, webinars, and a few plenary speeches. I have since expanded on the topic of transformational leadership by discussing the importance of emotional intelligence as a “must have” in the toolbox of correctional leaders. Emotional intelligence is essentially a subtopic of the larger transformational leadership style, but it is likely one of the most important leadership attributes, in my opinion.\nEmotional intelligence is loosely defined as the capacity or ability to be aware of, control, and expression of one’s emotions, as well as, the ability or capacity to cope with interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically. In other words, self-regulation of your own emotions and being able to “read” the body cues and emotions of others. Again, this was a skill that had already been popular within the fields of psychology and the private business sector, but was less known in criminal justice circles because we, in criminal justice, have a tendency to do things the way they have always been done. You know, maintaining the status quo (aka- old school) mentality, and as a profession, we are largely resistant to change, even if it makes our jobs better. The adage, work smarter not harder is something I personally embrace. In order to gauge whether I was moving in the right direction with my thoughts about the importance of emotional intelligence in corrections, I once again, published an article focusing on how emotional intelligence benefits correctional officers. This, too, led to subsequent publications, podcasts, webinars, and conference presentations. Most of us nerdy academic types would agree that the best papers and presentations are the ones in which the author / presenter exudes confidence and is clearly passionate about the topic because it is within their area of expertise, their comfort zone, and they can directly relate / identify to the topic, and they have likely applied the concepts to their own personal / professional lives. Walk the walk, talk the talk, right? Eastern State Penitentiary Source: Michael Pittaro\nEmotional intelligence can be seen as a type of social intelligence, separable from general intelligence. To expand on the earlier definition, emotional intelligence is the ability to monitor our own emotions as well as that of others, but to also use this information to guide one’s thinking and actions. Emotional intelligence influences how we cope with disappointment, frustration, anger , and so forth by learning how to control our emotions. In corrections, this is 100 percent critical. Losing our temper could easily lead to an incident in which a correctional officer uses excessive force or worse yet, deadly force. As we know in corrections, an incident in which excessive force is confirmed is followed up with a civil suit by the injured prisoner or his / her family and most of the time, the prison will lose.\nHere is an example of an incident that occurred when I worked in corrections. As most of us in corrections know, prisoners will “test” new officers by pushing their buttons, seeing if they will cross the line by breaking one of the many institutional rules, etc. We inform all new officers that this will most likely occur; therefore, they need to be firm, consistent, and realize that this hazing is some demented rite of passage established by prisoners likely hundreds of years ago. Well, as anticipated, the prisoners began to taunt the new officer using profanity and demeaning comments using some colorful derogatory terms. Prisoners are experts at stringing together a profanity laced tirade without pausing to take a breath, BUT they are only words. Long story short, the officer “snapped” and assaulted one of the prisoners who got under the officer’s skin. That is obviously an example of what not to do. Not only was the officer terminated, but he was criminally charged by the district attorney, and the “injured” prisoner, who became the victim, filed a successful civil suit. Reflecting back, this understandably could have been handled much differently if the officer would have remained in control of his emotions. Self-regulation is key.\nAnother story from my past involves a prisoner who just received the infamous “dear John” message from his girlfriend after making a collect call to the girlfriend’s residence. The typical response after a relationship breakup might be to try calling back, but prisoners are not entitled to making another call immediately following their initial call. And, the calls (at that time) were collect-call only, meaning that the person must accept the call, so chances are, she would not have accepted the charges for the second call. Criminal justice 101 tells us that most criminal offenders lack self-control, so as predicted, the prisoner snapped. He started banging the phone against the wall, subsequently destroying the phone, and was obviously experiencing a wide range of emotions. The officers immediately responded to the scene, but instead of taking the prisoner down and placing him in restraints, they allowed him to vent. It took some time, but the officers exhibited empathy because they were able to put themselves in his shoes, as they say, by considering how they would feel receiving a similar phone call. Woman in prison Source: Michael Pittaro\nWhile the prisoner’s response to the girlfriend’s call was a little extreme, most of us can understand how and why someone in a similar situation could lose control of their emotions. I was impressed by this response because the officers were able to understand the prisoner’s emotions and rather than taking aggressive action (well within prison protocol), they allowed him to vent and then explained to him that there would be disciplinary action (keep your word), including paying for the damaged phone, BUT if he did not resist to being handcuffed and returning to his cell, that would be the end of it. However, if he did resist, the criminal charges, along with internal disciplinary action, would have easily escalated to one or more felonies if an officer was assaulted in the process of restraining him.\nSanjay Kumar (2014) noted that one of the most prominent research developments involving emotional intelligence and transformational leadership is the confirmation of its utility for increasing organizational satisfaction, commitment, and effectives. Of all the various criminal justice professions, corrections has the unfortunate reputation of being the “stepping-stone” to other criminal justice positions. The high turnover rate, low morale, and job satisfaction, only validate the need for adopting a transformational leadership approach that relies heavily on developing emotional intelligence in correctional administrators and officers.\nFurthermore, Kumar emphasized the following: Emotional intelligence is critical to Transformational leaders Emotional intelligence is a strong predictor of job performance Transformational leaders having higher emotional intelligence show better quality of work performance Transformational leadership enhances organizational performance Transformational leaders are frequently motivated to go beyond the call of duty for the benefit of their organization Transformational leaders promote empowering cultural norms, high levels of subordinate motivation , commitment to quality, and enhanced productivity Transformational leaders feel excited, enthusiastic, and engaged, thus energizing their followers. Transformational leaders use these strong emotions to arouse similar feelings in their followers through emotional intelligence.\nIn criminal justice, we predominantly focus on our physical wellbeing, but not nearly as much attention is dedicated to our emotional wellbeing. A healthy mind is equally important as a healthy body, if not more so. Emotional intelligence can help those of us in criminal justice in maintaining a clearer, more optimistic view of the world that we often see through a very dark lens, thereby, minimizing the cynicism and jadedness that often comes with longevity on the job. As a self-described change agent, I am limited to educating and spreading awareness. It is up to those reading this article to put those tools and resources to good use if we want to improve the way we react and respond to stressful situations by performing emotional check-ins and by understanding the emotions of others and responding intelligently and rationally. Will this work every time? Absolutely not, but it will work in the majority of situations that we encounter. We have high rates of depression , anxiety , PTSD , and suicide in our profession. Changing our collective mindset can reduce the prevalence of those debilitating conditions. advertisement About the Author",

      "text": "The accolades flowed freely, as they should have Wednesday, when the University of Northwestern Ohio kicked off what will be a yearlong celebration of its 100 years in Lima.\nOf all the remarks made, though, one hit the proverbial nail on the head.\nIt came from a highly respected man who has served this region in many capacities during his adult life – state Rep. Robert Cupp. To paraphrase a popular TV commercial, Cupp knows a thing or two, because he’s seen a thing or two. And he couldn’t say enough about the UNOH story.\n“There are very few things when they start out that last for 100 years and beyond. So this is really a wonderful tribute,” Cupp told the hundreds of people who filled the school’s Event Center. “What a benefit it is to the community. It was a fairly quiet institution for a long time, but it certainly isn’t anymore. And the evidence is everywhere around us.”\nYes, it is.\nIt is truly amazing what has happened since the Northwestern School of Commerce, as it was first known, opened its doors in downtown Lima in 1920. Back then the school was strictly a training ground for those interested in business as it offered classes in administration and secretarial skills.\nThen along came the Jarvis family, the entreprenuers of education. Loren Jarvis purchased the college in 1969 and things quickly changed. Interestingly, he grew up on a farm near Spencerville, but never obtained a college degree. He did know the value of hard work though, and most of all, he was a visionary.\nHe moved the tiny business school to 1441 North Cable Road in 1973, where it could grow. Soon it became a thriving university. He was followed by his son Jeff, today’s president. Like his father, Jeff pushed the doors wide open to the future, allowing for big dreams to turn into reality. Today, when you talk about UNOH, you’re talking about an institution that proudly can proclaim:\n• It has gone from a downtown storefront to a 200-acre campus that crosses Cable Road and stretches all the way to Eastown Road with land also on Dutch Hollow Road.\n• All 50 states are represented by this year’s student body, which numbers more than 4,000 students.\n• Students from 41 countries have attended UNOH.\n• The university consists of five colleges, offering associate, bachelor and master’s degrees in 50 programs ranging from automotive technology, robotics and alternative fuels to the business world and medical field.\nWhat has been the catalyst for such growth?\nThat’s an easy question to answer, Jeff Jarvis will tell you. He’ll point out a 25-to-1 student to teacher ratio sets the university apart from most schools, and he’ll proudly boast about a group of employees that he says not only care about the school and the education it provides, but also the well-being of its students.\nSo what’s in the future for UNOH?\nKeep in mind the university has thrived by offering hands-on experience. Seventy percent of a student’s time is spent doing hands-on work in the classroom and the shop, with the other 30% spent learning the theory behind the technology. That’s a gold nugget that will remain the fuel for the university as it expands its footprint into the new world of automotive electric engines. We see the same for the school’s business school when it comes to being a leader in the ever-growing world of on-line business.\nAnd then there’s that dream that Jeff Jarvis expressed many years ago – building and operating a student-run hotel, where skills can be mastered in the hospitality industry.\nCould that mean an Eastown Road hotel is somewhere in the future for Lima?\nIf we have learned one thing about Jeff Jarvis during his 46 years at the school, it would be don’t underestimate him. He lives by the motto that anything is possible.\nCongratulations to all of those past and present who gave us a century of education. Here’s to 100 more years.\nhttps://www.limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/01/web1_editorial-icon-sunrise1-1.jpg Jeffrey Jarvis addresses the UNOH 100 Years Opening Ceremony at the UNOH Event Center on Wednesday.

      "text": "\nMark Graban recently wrote a blog post that reflects the current thinking of many and influences: “ It’s Hard to Ask Leaders to Change the System in Which They’ve Risen and Excelled .” The “system” in question is the management system and culture of the company or companies that leaders have worked in. Unfortunately, the “system” is much larger than any one company’s management practice or culture.\nThe “system” is a vast interconnected network of preconceptions that span eight categories: economic, social, political, historical, philosophical, legal, business, and spiritual. These preconceptions don’t just serve to passively maintain the status quo, they are used as the truthful basis for vigorously defending and conserving past successes built up over thousands of years. If one truly empathizes with leaders, they would understand that leaders perceive there to be far more at stake than simply changing the management practice or company culture.\nThe position of leader, coupled with the eight categories of preconceptions, vests one’s authority. This can be expressed by the simple formula, α > λ, where α is “authority” and λ is “Lean.” Authority passively preserves and vigorously defends the status quo such that Lean is overwhelmed and unable to take root in its full form. Lean management is either summarily rejected by leaders or permitted by leaders to exist for a time as “Fake Lean” for reasons of expediency. Changing the system in any context, small (company microeconomy) or large (global macroeconomy), is not important to leaders. And, therefore, it makes no sense to focus on changing leaders’ behaviors.\nIn cases where Lean transformation has been successful, these are more appropriately understood to be happy accidents. Few will admit to this reality because it does not serve one’s interests. While happy accidents are welcomed, the formula α > λ remains in force. However, it is slightly weakened to allow Lean management to exist in the desired form, but usually for only a period of time after which the full strength of α > λ reasserts itself. This occurs with the inevitable changes in leadership or ownership.\nLean management has difficulty competing because it does not offer a coherent explanatory framework that can guide leaders to a new way of thinking and doing things; a complete explanatory framework capable of disrupting the vast interconnected set of established economic, social, political, historical, philosophical, legal, business, and spiritual preconceptions. Social learning, an analog form of social media, transmits these preconceptions from one generation of leaders to the next. The preconceptions are sticky because together they produce a workable conceptual blueprint for the conduct of business affairs. The ideology of classical management, embedded in authority, α, is strong, while the ideology embedded in Lean, λ, is weak.\nBusiness leaders are the heroic defenders of the eight categories of preconceptions. Since 1988, the Lean movement’s path has been one of deterrence: “the action of discouraging an action or event through instilling doubt or fear of the consequences.” Despite our hopes otherwise, classical management is not deterrable. Lean is seen by leaders as a menace and so the way they contain it is to bureaucratize it; to suffocate it. The widespread confusion about what Lean is, the improper understanding and use of Lean tools, the plethora of bad information, incompetent consultants, coaches, and trainers, and Lean’s inability to appeal to laborers and the wider public give added life and expanded credibility to classical management. The working theory of classical management is simpler and has been unified over centuries, while Lean management’s working theory is complicated and has yet to be unified.\nThe conflict between management systems is a proxy for a much larger conflict. It is clear that classical management is no longer right for the times we live in. It hasn’t been right since the dawn of the Information Age soon after World War II. Yet, classical management has prospered in the 75 years since then. However, it seems likely that classical management will one day collapse from its many and growing weaknesses. Lean people need to be patient. But they also need to understand the larger system of authority, α, and the interconnected categories of preconceptions — economic, social, political, historical, philosophical, legal, business, and spiritual — that give classical management its endurance and power. The two books shown above are your resources for learning the larger system that Lean is up against. Broadening your thinking will broaden the results that the Lean movement hopes to achieve.",

      "text": "10 Things You Didn’t Know about Arielle Kebbel 10 Things You Didn’t Know about Arielle Kebbel Prev Article Next Article\nArielle Kebbel is an American actress . Generally speaking, people will recognize her because of her roles on TV shows such as Gilmore Girls and The Vampire Diaries. However, she has shown up in a wide range of other projects as well. Here are 10 things that you may or may not have known about Arielle Kebbel: 1. Born in Winter Park, FL\nKebbel was born in a place called Winter Park, FL. For those who are curious, it is one of the suburbs in the Orlando metropolitan area. The name of Winter Park is no coincidence, seeing as how it was founded as a resort community by rich and powerful business people from the North in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 2. Started Out As a Model Before Becoming an Actress\nIt is interesting to note that Kebbel started out as a model before she went on to become an actress. It seems safe to say that she was pretty successful in her earlier career, seeing as how she has been featured in high-profile publications such as FHM and Men’s Health. 3. Got Her First Role on Gilmore Girls\nThere are some actors and actresses who struggle for a while before getting their first role. In contrast, Kebbel managed to get her first role on Gilmore Girls within a single week of her moving to Los Angeles. For those who are curious, she played a recurring character named Lindsay Lister , who was a teenage girl of about the same age as the main character Rory Gilmore. Said character got caught up in Rory’s love life by dating Dean Forester following their break-up, thus resulting in a relationship that was serious enough for Lindsay and Dean to get married. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a particularly long-lasting marriage because the two divorced when Lindsay caught Dean cheating on her with Rory. 4. Got Her Film Debut in 2004\nSpeaking of which, Kebbel managed to get her film debut in 2004. In short, she played a supporting character named Heather Hunkee in a hip-hop comedy movie called Soul Plane . Said movie is centered on a man named Nashawn Wade who has a horrible experience with an airline, so much so that he manages to get awarded $100 million because of it. As a result, he decides that he wants to start up his own airline, which will cater to African Americans as well as hip-hop culture. Unsurprisingly, this is much easier said than done, thus resulting in plenty of shenanigans over the course of the movie. 5. Played the Villain in Aquamarine\nIn 2006, Kebbel played the villain named Cecilia Banks in Aquamarine, which managed to secure a fair measure of success. Said movie is centered on the character of the same name, a mermaid who is seeking to make a handsome lifeguard fall in love with her with some help from human teenagers so that she can prove the existence of love, thus saving her from having to get married to someone she doesn’t know. The plan fails, though less because of the villain’s efforts than because true romantic love isn’t that easy to come by. However, Aquamarine manages to escape her unwanted marriage anyways because the platonic love between friends counts for the same purpose. 6. Played One of the Main Characters in The Grudge 2\nIn the same year, Kebbel played one of the main characters in The Grudge 2. Those who are unfamiliar should know that said movie was the American follow-up to the American remake of the Japanese horror movie Ju-On: The Grudge. As a result, it is distinct from the Japanese follow-up to the Japanese original called Ju-On: The Grudge 2. Regardless, The Grudge 2 is interesting in that it featured the return of the survivor from its predecessor. However, it isn’t a simple and straightforward follow-up, seeing as how its narrative is unfolded in a non-linear manner. 7. On Ballers\nKebbel had a relatively important role on Ballers. The main character of the show is a retired football player turned financial manager for current football players named Spencer Strasmore. Kebbel played a local sportscaster named Tracy Legette who is in a relationship with Strasmore. 8. Main Role On Lincoln Rhyme: Hunt For the Bone Collector\nCurrently, Kebbel has one of the main roles on Lincoln Rhyme: Hunt For the Bone Collector. This is a crime drama in which the titular character suffered serious injuries while working as a forensic criminologist, with the result that he has been rendered paraplegic. However, that doesn’t stop him from working with Kebbel’s character – a young NYPD officer – to solve various crimes. Together, the two seek to hunt down an infamous serial killer nicknamed the Bone Collector, thus explaining the name of the show. Presumably, that will serve as the show’s overarching narrative, while less notorious cases and criminals will serve to fill in the spaces between that narrative. However, only time can tell exactly how the people behind the show will keep the audience engaged while still keeping the show running. For that matter, only time can tell how the show will fare because it has just started up. 9. Has a Couple of Siblings\nIn total, Kebbel has two siblings. One is a brother named Christian, while the other is a sister named Julia. It should be mentioned that Julia went missing for a period of two weeks in 2018. Fortunately, she was found, having been affected by an episode of bipolar disorder. For those who are unfamiliar, bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings from emotional highs to emotional lows. Some sufferers experience them on a relatively rare basis. In contrast, other sufferers can experience them multiple times in a single year. 10. Supports Reach Back LA\nKebbel has been known to support a nonprofit called Reach Back Los Angeles. Said nonprofit exists to provide an environment for at-risk youth as well as at-risk young adults in which they can continue to learn as well as otherwise develop themselves. As such, Reach Back Los Angeles runs a wide range of programs with examples including but not limited to fitness programs, arts education, health education, and college prep.",

I don't ask from where his debt coming from because this is his business. Obviously I would try to help out but doesn't mean I carry his financial burden. I see that this person is actively trying to pay off the debts and not sitting on them like a lazy bum. I chose this person because it is about the person, not the materialistic things.\nu/emm421 You are missing out on meeting great people if you only think that is something you don't want to \"burden\" the people with. Believe me, there will be people who don't give a single fuck whether you're in debt or not and still want to date you because of your personality :)",

      "title": "Who cares about old company pension pots?",
      "text": "In this article I look at the legacy of old company pension schemes, set up by employers for staff as an alternative to defined benefit schemes. I n a report in 2018, the Pensions Regulator looked at these schemes and found that most of the problems were with small schemes which had little or no value to employers. I call these schemes company pensions , most pre-date the arrival of auto-enrolment in 2012 and the workplace pensions that dominate the market today. Do employers have proper choice when choosing a pension for their staff?\nWe are now two years on from the end of the auto-enrolment staging period , it is getting on for eight years since staging began and, other than the loss of a few minor contenders, the make-up of those offering services to employers is much as it was when Smart entered the market in 2015.\nNOW Pensions wobbled, Salvus and Carey went to the wire on authorisation and Legal & General radically restricted its market by not taking small employers. But only SuperTrust had to withdraw its application for authorisation. Contrary to expectations – there remains a wide range of providers competing for the 10.5m new members from 1m new employers, as well for those schemes set up in advance of auto-enrolment by mature employers.\nEmployers can now choose from 37 authorised master trusts which have more than £36bn in assets under management between them, 16 million memberships, and total financial reserves of £524m.\nThey can choose from 5 insurers, Aviva, L&G, Aegon, Standard Life, Royal London and Scottish Widows who offer Group Personal Pensions as workplace pensions and there remain a handful of SIPP providers , most notably Hargreaves Lansdown, who offer SIPPs to employers under auto-enrolment.\nThere is a proper choice for employers choosing workplace pensions today A market increasingly dominated by master trusts.\nThe trend towards consolidation continues. The master trusts that did not apply for authorisation are being absorbed into larger master trusts.\nHSBC has been authorised as a master trust but has yet to state its intentions for new business. It is generally assumed it will seed with the HSBC staff scheme and there’s considerable speculation as to where it will predate. HSBC may well disrupt the existing order but has yet to show its hand.\nMaster trusts have the capacity to absorb new business through bulk transfer where deals can be signed off by employers and trustees without the consent of the transferred members. Groups of Personal Pensions (GPP’s) cannot transfer pots from one provider to another without member consent. Setting up a new GPP involves setting up a new policy for each member of staff, for consolidation to happen, each pot needs to transfer at the individual policyholder’s consent.\nWhen it comes to consolidation (which is the commercial driver for change) it is the master-trusts and not the GPPs which are on the front row of the grid. The last time that HSBC made a predatory play was as a personal pension provider – some fifteen years ago – times have changed.\n… for most employers with a failing scheme, master trusts will be the obvious answer How are master trusts competing?\nThere are large numbers of workplace pension schemes which look inefficient and ripe for consolidation. The competition for consolidation is driven by consultancy owned master trusts, primarily those of Aon, Willis Towers Watson and Mercer, but followed by a range of others – including Salvus, Creative , Atlas and Nations owned by Goddard Perry, CBS, Capita and XPS respectively.\nThese schemes are today building their business plans around expansion. They see the low hanging fruit as the 41,000 occupational pension schemes established as DC plans and maintained by employers under their own trusts.\nFor the workforces of large employers like Tesco, competition is fierce. But for the fat and long tail of legacy DC schemes (including GPPs), I already see the likelihood of market failure\nMy worry is once again about the consultants (and to some degree the insurers) . They compete for these schemes like whales compete for plancton, they open up their mouths and the schemes swim in , primarily because the employers have used the consultancies as advisers or have no adviser and are in the hands of the insurers.\nInsurers are keen to compete with their master trusts. Aviva, Scottish Widows, Legal and General and Aegon all have master trusts and HSBC will join them.\nNEST, People’s Pension , Smart and NOW are potentially competitive in this plancton hoover-up. However they don’t have the pre-existing relationships of the consultants and insurers and may struggle to repeat in the hoover-up what they achieved during the staging of auto-enrolment – when they had most of the market to themselves.\nThe big four, are either suffering from indigestion – from a surfeit of new business in the past eight years, or (in the case of Smart) looking abroad.\nCompetition for old DC company pensions is more likely to come from younger entrants than the big four How far does competition go?\nWhat I haven’t seen develop in the UK is a utility that puts the employer in control of the purchasing decision.\nIf an employer wants to tender the scheme it has established (occupational or GPP), it is pretty well bound to use a consultant. But most consultants would rather compete as providers of master trusts than as the organisers of tenders. Those few consultants who are independent of master trusts (Hymans Robertson, LCP, First Actuarial and the accountancy practices) are likely to prosper where competitive tendering is going on. But much of the acquisition of “plancton” is not going through the competitive tendering process. DC schemes are simply passing into the mouths of consultants like Krill.\nI suspect that the mistakes of fiduciary managers in the DB space are being repeated and very much hope that tPR and FCA will have a look at what is going on – especially where schemes are unloved, employers uninterested and the money of members is a secondary consideration.\nIn such cases – the secondary market for failing DC schemes may not always be competitive. What needs to change?\nThe Pensions Regulator recognises that many occupational pension schemes are unfit to meet today’s challenges . Many are overly-expensive, poorly governed and badly managed. They are struggling to deliver value for money to members, to comply with rules for tougher disclosures and worst of all, they often have poor data controls meaning many members may not have accurate records. These problems will come out when these schemes are mandated to participate in the digital data-sharing with the pensions dashboard\nFor such employers to be in control, three things need to happen Employers need to recognise (or be told) that the schemes they set up , are their responsibility Where employers aren’t prepared to sponsor their own scheme they need to access a secondary market of providers which enables employers to tender their schemes to the benefit of members. Someone needs to set up such a tendering facility on-line for the benefit of employers, members and competition. For orphaned schemes (where the employer is no more), tPR needs to become the tenderer and should use this service.\nAccess to a competitive secondary market for employers wishing to dispose of their DC pension schemes is limited. Lessons to be learned\nMillions of us have pension pots in schemes run by former employers. These schemes are hard to find and harder to get information on. Many of these schemes are ripe for change and they will be absorbed into master-trusts.\nMembers will have very little say in the matter and there is insufficient impulsion on employers to get a good deal for our money. This is a recipe for poor practice and it is easy to see competition failing as it did with fiduciary management.\nThe FCA and tPR should look into the market and in particular the tendering process for schemes where the employer is reluctant to pay fees.\nThere is a market opportunity for the industry to set up a tendering utility for the disposal of failing DC schemes into viable authorised master trusts.

      "text": "Wanting to Know, Preferring to Ignore January 13, 2020\nThose of us who are fans of Toyota’s management system (TMS) and Lean management (LM) are a curious bunch. We want to learn as much as we can as fast as possible. We want to know the details of TMS and LM and how to make them work in ways that fulfill our understanding and our expectations. We are voracious consumers of information that will help satisfy our intellectual appetites and practical needs. By we, I mean professional salaried staff. Lean has proven to be far less appealing to laborers and executives.\nIn most cases, our interest in TMS and LM is not shared throughout the organizational hierarchy. And we struggle to gain consistent understandings of fundamentals such as kaizen, standard work, and flow. Value stream maps, A3 reports, and other methods and tools remain widely misunderstood and misused. The pace of process improvement that is necessary for remaining competitive in free markets is also misunderstood. The continuous improvement clock tells time in days or weeks, not months or years.\nWhile rich in substance, TMS and LM are pitifully weak in terms of their fundamental appeal to the top leaders of organizations and society at-large. TMS and LM are niche-of-a-niche interests within the much larger fields of leadership and management that remain dominated by tradition. Perhaps that will change someday.\nThe desire by professional salaried staff to know about TMS and LM are commendable. Yet the situation that I have described is basically the existence of myriad defects, despite all the good information produced over five decades — conferences, training, books, videos, podcasts, blogs, etc. It is apparent that people have had great difficulty separating the good information from the bad information. They also have difficulty putting the good information into practice. This points to another dynamic in play: a desire by leaders and laborers to perpetuate traditions and thus maintain the status quo. Leaders, of course, have vast powers to make that happen compared to laborers, so leaders must be the focal point.\nThe thirst for information about TMS and LM is much greater than the desire to understand how and why leaders maintain their grip to a bygone era. It is hard to believe that TMS or LM will become the common leadership and management practice if this problem is not understood and if ideas are not generated try so that business and society can make needed progress. The preference to ignore this problem is understandable because it is complicated and uncomfortable, and solutions are not obvious or easy. Furthermore, it is not difficult to imagine that solutions could be effortlessly blocked by those in power. Yet, preferring to ignore (see examples here and here ) does not solve problems.\nThe spirit of TMS and LM is curiosity, problem-solving, and to persist in pursuing improvement despite the obstacles that one encounters. This, coupled with the fact that neither nor the Lean community at-large is satisfied with the current state, should generate an intense desire to know what is impeding progress. The usual superficial characterizations of the impediments have proven themselves to be insufficient in terms of informing problem-solving. A deeper understanding is required, and that is what I have sought to provide in recent years.\nThese two books (learn more here and here ) illuminate the problem in ways that have never been described before. They are deep dives into the how and why leaders maintain their grip to a bygone era. They are meant to help move the practice of TMS and LM forward, but not in the usual way. If you read the books, they will make you feel there is nothing you can do to reverse the situation. You may feel defeated and lose hope. You will feel frustrated and perhaps angry or may even cry. Go through those emotions for a day or a week or a month, but then re-focus on the task at hand. The purpose of these books is to present the ugly truth and then to stimulate your thinking so that new ideas are generated. By doing this, the opportunity is for TMS and LM to have a larger presence in business and society in the coming 50 years than they have had in the last 50 years. Preferring to ignore the ugly truth will render TMS and LM as nothing more than interesting and occasionally useful curiosities. You can help prevent that from happening.",

      "text": "Share on Facebook Share Tweet Email Print\n\"Phase One\" of the resolution of the United States-China trade war was signed earlier this week, and it had some pretty big wins for the Trump administration.\nWrit large in media headlines were two things the United States did well to get Beijing to sign onto -- agreements from China to crack down on intellectual property theft and to increase imports from the United States by $200 billion over 2 years. Advertisement - story continues below\nWhether or not Chinese President Xi Jinping's government actually enforces any of this is another question entirely, but that's why it's called \" Phase One .\"\nPresident Donald Trump insisted, according to CNBC , that the agreement had “total and full enforceability.”\nDuring the signing, he said the two countries were “righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security for American workers, farmers and families.” TRENDING: Trump pokes fun at himself during LSU White House ceremony, left loses it\nMost of the tariffs from the trade war will remain in place, according to Reason , and the deal is still a rough sketch.\nStill, the fact that China was even willing to agree to any of this in the first place was, at the very least, a major win for the United States -- particularly since we were told how the trade war with China was going to end in tears. Advertisement - story continues below\nAs it turns out, if there are any tears being shed, they're likely coming from Beijing.\nOn the same week that the \"Phase One\" agreement was signed, China revealed its economic growth in 2019 was the lowest it's been in 29 years -- 6.1 percent, according to Reuters .\nWhile that growth was by no means slow by global standards, it was a major cooling-off from the 6.6 percent growth China experienced in 2018.\nFurthermore, experts predicted the world's second-largest economy would further cool to 5.9 percent growth in 2020.\nThe sluggish growth was, according to Reuters, recorded \"amid a bruising trade war with the United States, and more stimulus is expected this year as Beijing tries to boost sluggish investment and demand.\" Advertisement - story continues below\n“We expect China’s growth rate will come further down to below 6% percent in 2020,\" Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at Sony Financial Holdings in Japan, told Reuters.\n“The Chinese economy is unlikely to fall abruptly because of ... government policies, but at the same time the trend of a further slowdown of the economy will remain unchanged.”\nReuters reported that \"[e]asing trade tensions have made manufacturers more optimistic about the business outlook, analysts said, though many of the tit-for-tat tariffs both sides imposed during the trade war remain in place.\"\nWhile U.S. GDP growth isn't exactly as robust as China's -- we're a far more mature economy, which means we don't put up rocket-ship numbers the same way that Beijing does -- our third-quarter gross domestic product growth was actually higher than expected. Advertisement - story continues below\n\"The Commerce Department said Wednesday that economic activity grew at an annualized rate of 1.9% in the third quarter, down slightly from the 2% pace in the second quarter. Economists polled by Dow Jones had expected the first look at third-quarter economic growth to come in at 1.6%,\" CNBC reported in October.\nAs the White House pointed out, too, the third-quarter results made this the longest run of economic expansion in recorded U.S. history.\n\"As today’s advance Gross Domestic Product (GDP) release confirms, economic growth continued in the third quarter of 2019, beating market expectations and adding to the expansion’s record length. The release also confirms that the Trump Administration’s policies support sustained economic growth and lead to higher incomes for American families,\" the White House said in a statement upon the release of the numbers.\n\"In its final projection before the 2016 election, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that real GDP would grow at a 2.1 percent annual rate in the first 11 quarters of a new Administration. Instead, under President Trump, real GDP as of the third quarter has grown at a strong 2.6 percent annual rate since the election. As of the third quarter, real GDP is $230 billion -- or 1.2 percent -- higher than CBO’s projection. Advertisement - story continues below\n\"Furthermore, under President Obama’s expansion period, real GDP grew at only a 2.2 percent annual rate compared to the Trump Administration’s 2.6 percent rate.\"\nNow, protectionism for protectionism's sake and modern-day mercantilism are things any sensible conservative should be against, which is why an all-out economic war over mere trade deficits is something the United States would do well to avoid.\nThis being said, using tariffs as a means to an end -- particularly when it comes to China, which has been a bad actor on the economic stage for decades and has made little effort to change -- is a very necessary evil.\nBeijing has long promised that it will open up its economy and protect intellectual property . It hasn't. Advertisement - story continues below\nWhether or not \"Phase One\" makes any difference remains to be seen, but it's a promising first step,\nWhat we do know is that the trade war has hurt China . And, from the looks of things, it's hurt them more than it's hurt us.\nFurthermore, it's changed the \"calculus\" of the matter, according to George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen.\n\"The U.S. has established its seriousness as a counterweight to China, something lacking since it largely overlooked China’s various territorial encroachments in the 2010s,\" he wrote in an Op-Ed for Bloomberg on Wednesday. Advertisement - story continues below\n\"Whether in economics or foreign policy, China now can expect the U.S. to push back -- a very different calculus. At a time when there is tension in North Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea, that is potentially a significant gain.\n\"President Donald Trump’s tariffs did hurt U.S. consumers, and while that is indeed an economic cost of the deal, it is also a credibility benefit,\" he continued.\n\"It shows that the U.S. is in fact willing to incur some pain to oppose China, contrary to the common Chinese view that Americans are 'soft.' U.S. credibility has also been improved among its allies and some neutral nations.\"\nTrump's tariffs, in the end, haven't been deadly for us and they've forced Beijing to the table. Advertisement - story continues below\nThat's a major change from where we were a few short years ago -- and it's one for the better",

      "text": "I’m e when it comes to this especially school age kids ( like her child is ).\nAlthough independent play and exploration is important In today’s society the need to teach our kids how to manage electronics is essential . Everything runs through STEM ( science , technology , engineering , and mathematics ) . As early as kindergarten schools are beginning to use computers and tablets and by first grade a lot of their work is online .\nBy 6th grade many specialty schools have begun teaching their kids robotics and computer coding . My son will be going to a science and engineering middle school that has a young explorers program with NASA next year and they’ve asked if he doesn’t own a phone to take an old phone to school because they encourage WiFi and technology usage . By 7th grade these kids are building their own robot program and by 8th grade knowing Microsoft certifications ( what most now 30 something year olds had to go to college for ) . It’s the world we live in . Every business structure is also leaning towards technology . As parents we have to begin finding that happy median place or we could be severely impacting our kids or setting them back. I can’t begin to tell you how many facepalm moments I have at work with my team trying to get them caught up with the times on systems and as a leader when interviewing I legitimately have technology role playing scenarios to see if the candidate can indeed work certain systems .\nWhat I try and do on my end is have “electronic hour “ periods throughout the day followed by downtime’s & then just try and space it out",

      "text": "BENGALURU: Sonia Dhawan , who joined back Paytm in June last year after being accused of data theft and blackmail along with others, has left Paytm to work at venture capital firm SAIF Partners, people aware of the matter said. She has joined the venture capital firm as advisor--corporate communications where she will be working on communications and marketing for SAIF's portfolio companies--which includes Paytm besides food delivery startup Swiggy, logistics venture Rivigo, and home services company UrbanClap.\nSAIF Partners confirmed the development to TOI. Dhawan also confirmed to TOI that she joined SAIF earlier this year and that she left Paytm late last year. SAIF Partners has been an early backer of Paytm since 2007 and are currently holds about a 20% stake in the company.\nAfter getting bail in the case of extortion of Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma last year, she had joined the Noida-based company's gaming business unit--Paytm First Games--as its head of corporate communications and marketing. Though Sharma had filed the case in 2018, he had told The Economic Times that she might have been a pawn in someone else’s plan.\nDhawan was also allotted employee stock option plans (ESOP) of Paytm in June. She is out on bail right now as the case continues in court.",

      "text": "In Woodrow Wilson's first Inaugural address, he supports many progressive beliefs. First off, he talks about America's carelessness towards nature. He says that he supports the preservation and conservation of nature, and believes that the United States is taking it for granted. He later says that he is for changing our economic, banking, and industrial systems away from tariffs, monopolies, and restricting credits to a newer system that helps the common man, not the 1%. Lastly, Wilson touches upon labor and health reforms, and says that we don't care enough about human life. He continues and talks about sanitary laws, food quality laws, and labor conditions laws in order to help all Americans.\n Synthesis: Woodrow Wilson's progressive ideas were similar to Theodore Roosevelts in that both presidents supported labor reform, better working conditions, workers compensation, and ending big business and monopolies.

A lead forecaster meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Flagstaff, Mr. McCollum will present results from the National Climate Assessment including what changes are being observed in the southwest United States and Arizona, as well as the predicted changes for the rest of this century.\nNorthern AZ Climate Change Alliance will feature a presentation and discussion by Flagstaff Lead Meteorologist, Darren McCollum presenting Climate Change and the Impacts on the Southwest at the Cottonwood Public Library, 100 South Sixth Street, Cottonwood, Arizona. The Saturday, February 1, 2020 program will explore why human activities are changing the climate of our planet, and give a brief overview on climate related impacts being observed globally and nationally.\nDarren will present results from the National Climate Assessment, including what changes are being observed in the southwest U.S./Arizona, as well as predicted changes for the rest of this century beginning at 12:30 PM and ending at 1:45 PM. This will shine a light on how climate change is a local issue. With this knowledge, we can better understand why we, as individuals need to get involved, make personal changes and sacrifices to safeguard our community and begin to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change in the southwest. David McCollum is with the National Weather Service in Flagstaff AZ.\nDarren McCollum received his Master of Science degree in Meteorology from the University of Oklahoma focusing on the severe weather patterns of the monsoon and Gulf of California moisture surges that are so important to an active monsoon thunderstorm environment. For two years he served as a Research Associate at the National Severe Storms Laboratory with a continued focus on the Arizona monsoon. From 1994 – 1998, he worked as an intern at the National Weather Service in Tucson, and since 1998 he has been with the National Weather Service in Flagstaff, initially as Journey Forecaster, and since 1999 as Lead Forecaster/Meteorologist.\nNorthern AZ Climate Change Alliance mission is to educate and empower people to take action now against the negative impact the climate crisis is having on our planet. NAZCCA is a grassroots, non-partisan, non-profit 501c3 organization.

      "title": "Microsoft Commits $1 Billion to Going 'Carbon Negative' in 10 Years",
      "text": "By Kurt Mackie January 16, 2020\nMicrosoft is aiming to become \"carbon negative\" by 2030 thanks to a companywide carbon-reduction initiative it announced on Thursday.\nThese efforts, if extended to 2050, will have removed the company's carbon emissions since its founding back in 1975, company officials claimed, although that plan will depend, in part, on some carbon-removal technologies not yet available. In the meantime, Microsoft will rely on common methods, such as tree planting to sequester carbon, prior to the emergence of these new technologies.\nMicrosoft's portfolio of \"negative emission technologies\" potentially will include things like \"afforestation and reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCs), and direct air capture (DAC),\" according to an announcement .\n$1B Climate Fund The company's carbon-reduction plans were announced on Thursday in a public presentation, available on demand here . It featured CEO Satya Nadella, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood and President Brad Smith. Also joining the presentation was Lucas Joppa, Microsoft's chief environmental officer.\nDuring the talk, Nadella announced a Microsoft $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund. It'll be used to invest in new technologies and provide capital to people working on the global-warming crisis. Hood said that Microsoft will form the $1 billion fund by taking on debt or direct equity.\n\"We understand that this [fund] is just a fraction of the investment needed, but our hope is that it spurs more governments and companies to invest in new ways as well,\" Microsoft indicated in its announcement.\nCarbon Measurements Smith said that protecting the planet was \"the ultimate moonshot.\" Microsoft plans to take three steps to help, including having a commitment to transparency on carbon emissions, fostering an effort to remove regulatory barriers to carbon-reduction technologies and advancing market-based incentives to put a price on carbon.\nMicrosoft is planning to publish annual reports that will share its carbon emissions data. Smith added that the world needs a consistent way to measure carbon.\nMicrosoft has signed on to the United Nation's Business Ambition plan for setting a 1.5-degrees Centigrade temperature increase limit, Smith indicated. The Business Ambition plan currently has 75 CEO signatories. It aims for \"a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.\"\nMicrosoft contrasted the net-zero carbon goal with being \"carbon neutral.\" Microsoft claims to have already \"achieved carbon neutrality primarily by investing in offsets that primarily avoid emissions instead of removing carbon that has already been emitted.\" However, instead of being carbon-neutral, the goal should be achieving net-zero emissions, \"meaning that humanity must remove as much carbon as it emits each year,\" Microsoft argued.\nMicrosoft plans to achieve its goals by working with its partners, as well as carrying out its own initiatives. Moreover, by the year 2025, Microsoft will have power purchase agreements in place for 100 percent renewable energy. \"We will be a 100 percent green company,\" Smith said. Microsoft estimated that it'll be responsible for 16 million metric tons of carbon production for this year alone, Smith indicated.\nMicrosoft explained that scientists measure carbon production in terms of three scopes. Scope 1 represents direct emissions, such as using a car. Scope 2 concerns indirect the emissions that come from using electricity or heat. Scope 3 (the largest source of carbon emissions) represents indirect emissions from all other activities.\nMicrosoft claims that 12 million metric tons of its 16 million metric tons output estimated for this year will fall into the Scope 3 category. The whole approach to the climate crisis should be based on good \"carbon math,\" Microsoft argued.\nWhat About Growth? Missing from Microsoft's calculations was the very thing that has boosted Microsoft as one of the top companies on the planet, with one of the highest market capitalizations -- namely, capitalism itself. Like a cancer, capitalism constantly needs to grow to thrive. It has historically accelerated its growth, in part, by externalizing its costs to the general public, including pollution costs. However, the effects of global warming are making those sorts of externalizations harder to conceal.\nMicrosoft's datacenters consume lots of energy and have been expanded worldwide as Microsoft steers the world toward cloud computing and using services. Microsoft has now published a Microsoft Sustainability Calculator that purports to show the efficiencies of using Azure services versus a local datacenter -- provided that you trust Microsoft's calculations.\nJoppa described the Microsoft Sustainability Calculator as a representation of the many Microsoft products that will focus on gaining carbon clarity. He also described some of Microsoft's partner efforts during the talk. Johnson Controls is using wind-powered Azure services to control heating in buildings. Vattenfall helps ensure that renewable energy gets used in Azure datacenters. SilviaTerra uses AI and satellite imagery to count trees and understand their carbon sequestration potential, Joppa said.

There would be a lot of mileage in having the story subsequently unfold with the lady boss gradually but determinedly decoupling the younger woman from boyfriend and family... possibly having her move in as her slave in all but name.",

      "text": "Agreeing with this - even if you can just do a year, or a few meetings, you’ll see the fundraising associations numbers and be able to evaluate whether the strategy is worthwhile, and suggest or help with events that may have a better payoff - generally anything where the actual money stays out of third party hands (raffle tickets at craft sales, selling donated treats, 50/50 raffles at school events, paint nights lead by talented parents) is a better bang.\nThere were some things that weren’t a huge money maker, but increased community engagement or people just “liked” them, so we kept them up (popcorn sales, sales of school logo clothing from a local business).\nAnd your fundraising society should have a clearly stated goal - like we want $X per classroom for each teacher to give fun prizes as encouragement, we’d like $XX for technology upgrades, whatever.\nOften just doing the corporate fundraising means that your society is low on volunteers (because they don’t require much to roll out/organize). Even if you can’t commit to every meeting, knowing that you can be available for select events can increase confidence enough to start doing some in-house stuff. There are also years when fundraising isn’t super necessary, but they need to keep the society running anyway, so low effort initiatives are the ones that get done.\nEdit: And don’t be afraid to run fundraisers that are basically “you can give us money for this thing we need” - more people will often donate to those because they don’t want crappy chocolate, either.",

      "text": "The Medical Centre Building in downtown Brandon could once again be filled with patients seeing doctors as efforts are underway to find a new tenant for its long-vacant clinic.\n\"As folks in Brandon would know, Western Medical Clinic was the tenant of that space for many years,\" said John Jackson, a community advocate who has been retained by the building's owners to fill that space. The job is unrelated to Jackson's role as executive director of Samaritan House Ministries.\n\"Ever since they left, it really has left something of a void, I would say, in downtown,\" Jackson said.\n\"We know folks who live downtown come from a mixture of socio-economic backgrounds, but we do know that there are a number of folks who are quite vulnerable and have high health and mental-health needs,\" he said. \"And so, the less barriers that exist to them being able to find a family doctor the better, so I think it'll be really beneficial in that sense.\"\nThe Medical Centre Building on Sixth Street between Rosser and Princess avenues had been home to the clinic since the mid-1960s, until the clinic relocated to new space on Victoria Avenue in 2015.\nSince then, the space on the downtown building's main floor has sat largely vacant with the exception of short-term tenants. A waiting area and offices are still in the space they are hoping to fill.\nSuper Thrifty Drugs Medical Centre Pharmacy is also located in the building, while Bright Side Dental and OMLC Vision Centre occupy the upper level.\nBrandon Professional Building, the property owner, is seeking to not only fill the space but meet the needs of people in the downtown area, said Jackson, who is also a registered psychiatric nurse who has experience in recruiting and health-care human resources.\nA spokesman for Brandon Professional Building could not be reached for comment on Saturday.\nJackson said he was retained earlier this month to find a new tenant, adding they are in the process of formulating and executing a strategy.\nThere are other medical clinics downtown, including Rosser Medical Clinic at 841 Rosser Ave., as well as other health-related services, Jackson noted, but it's still lacking in terms of general practice physicians.\n\"It's not like there's nobody else,\" he said, adding that doesn't discount the need for another clinic in the downtown.\n\"You know how we hear people talk about food deserts and how close people are to grocery stores and things like that. You can think the same from a public-health perspective about access to physicians,\" he said.\nAll of Western Medical Clinic’s 11 physicians moved into the 10,000-square-foot space on Victoria Avenue, along with two new doctors who joined the practice, the Sun reported in October 2015.\n\"I believe the new location will give us a new look and improve deficiencies, as well as an opportunity to expand our physician group,\" Sandra Levandoski, business manager with Western Medical Clinic Medical Corp., told the Sun in an interview at the time.\nA spokesman for the adjacent Super Thrifty Drug pharmacy in the downtown building was not available to comment Saturday on what a reopened medical clinic would mean for them.\n» brobertson@brandonsun.com, with file from Jillian Austin",

      "title": "Meet Viviana Espinosa: The Woman Behind the Groundbreaking Meal Prep Business From Miami “Eating By V”",
      "text": "One of the newest trends from recent years has been meal preparation. In the past few years, there has been a rise in businesses created to address the need for easier meal preparation or even at times, for prepared meal delivery. These efforts are directed towards people who do not really have the time to prepare their own meals and instead eat whatever they find in their way. Fortunately, people like Viviana Espinosa are ahead of all of us and have this covered. Viviana, who was born and raised in Miami, runs one of her city’s favorite meal preparation and delivery services: Eating By V . “I began my journey in the food industry when I was 16, as a server at Applebees. I gradually moved up, getting better and better positions in high class restaurants, where I learned from top chefs and restaurant managers how to create a great experience for the people they fed.” Viviana recounts . Soon after these experiences, Viviana got into a long-term relationship and was encouraged to leave her work to instead take the house-wife role. Her cooking was devoted to cooking for her partner, rather than for other people as she had previously done. But this relationship eventually ended. “After my breakup and the subsequential heartbreak that ensued, I took a leap of faith to become the boss instead of working for someone else. That is when my idea for Eating By V, my meal preparation and delivery service took off.” Viviana shares . In just seven days, Viviana had 40 people supporting her and signing up to receive her meals. With that, she was able to fund her business, which is now after only 2 years, one of Miami’s favourite meal prep services–having fed over a thousand people in the Miami-Dade area and being the only female-owned and operated meal prep business in the city. “The biggest challenge when starting a business is finding the right people who you can trust. Skilled people come in all shapes and sizes, but the most important qualities a person can possess is good communication, loyalty, timeliness and a positive mental attitude. Finding those people can prove challenging, but is the most rewarding!” Viviana says . Viviana was inspired to get into this industry because of the love she had always had for this industry, ever since she was 16. After learning and obtaining experience, she decided to take a chance on herself and become the boss. But she also stresses the importance of having the right mindset. “Without the right mindset, you are bound to fail. Life will always put obstacles and challenges in your way, but with a resilient mindset you can accomplish anything. My mentor taught me ‘The big shooter is just the small shooter who kept shooting’.” Viviana states . For Viviana, the first months of Eating By V were chaotic, but through her strong mindset she was able to not give into other people’s doubts or her own, which is why she claims that a strong mindset can be the most vital and rewarding tool for long-term success. “My advice to anyone trying to start their business is to just go for it. To take a shot and learn from your mistakes and try again. Try a thousand times if that is how long it takes to reach your goal. And also make sure to focus on relationships with people.” Viviana advises . Eating By V is a very successful business venture. For Viviana, success is precisely pursuing what you love and pushing your limits with that passion to see how far you can take it. It has been important to see fear as just “false evidence appearing real” in order to achieve this. Viviana’s next projects include expanding Eating By V to 500 monthly clients. They are currently launching an iOS app and expanding their line of products to juices, snacks and even providing private catering. Eating By V is different from their competition not only in that it is the only woman-founded and managed business of its kind, but also in that they focus on creating the best experience with our clients, which is part of why they are looking forward to being the first meal prep business in the industry to have an iOS app available, because “in today’s age, convenience is key,” as Viviana says.

      "text": "The public never will know what really goes into the process of hiring a city manager for Stockton.\nUnlike some cities, which announce finalists or hold meet and greets, the candidates here are kept confidential until the deal is up for approval before the City Council.\nCandidates have been swept into back doors at City Hall and, in one case, a candidate withdrew after his name became public and Council questioned details of his proposed deal.\nAnd that leads us to Harry E. Black, who last week was named Stockton city manager, succeeding Kurt Wilson, who was fired in July, after five years as city manager.\nBlack’s annual salary will be $270,000, a bump from the $261,283 he received in his last public post as city manager of Cincinnati. He resigned from that in April 2018 before an expected vote to fire him.\nOn paper, Black looks like a fine candidate. In the past year, he has been a finalist for city manager jobs for Gainesville, Florida; Corpus Christi, Texas; and, as recently as Jan. 9, Laredo, Texas.\nAt times, a city manager being dismissed is not surprising. Council members change, strategic direction changes and there are times that the skill set required to do one thing — i.e. fiscal prudence shown coming out of bankruptcy — are not the same skills needed moving forward — i.e. spend money carefully and develop a vision to serve residents while remaining fiscally responsible.\nBut also, it can be said that your character does not change and what you are in one place is what you will be in another. As it goes: past behavior serves as the best predictor of future behavior.\nWilson behaved in Stockton similarly as he did in Ridgecrest, where he served as city manager for two years before coming to Stockton as deputy city manager in 2012.\nAmong the things said of Wilson during his stint in Ridgecrest, these comments are from the Ridgecrest Daily Independent:\nPraise: Wilson inherited one mess after another and quietly went about his business and came up with solutions, not always popular with the public or council members. Not one seeking the limelight, Wilson worked behind the scenes. Efficient and detailed, he took a straight and narrow path, not wavering, in making things happen for the city.\nBiggest thing he did was put a lid on the redundant public discussion of the trash issue.\nCriticism: His salary, reported to be around $175,000, and for paying six-figure salaries to department heads during a time of financial crisis. Residents also have complained that Wilson’s failure to relocate to Ridgecrest during his two years on the job showed a lack of investment. But the No. 1 criticism of Wilson — from councilmembers, staffers and citizens alike — has been his apparent lack of communication.\nDoes any of that sound familiar?\nWilson has filed a lawsuit against the city, alleging breach of contract and violations of the Brown Act open-meetings law. His salary was $259,488.\nAnd again, that leads us to Black, who will begin as Stockton’s city manager in less than a month.\nIt would be reasonable to expect him to perform in Stockton as he has in Cincinnati and other places where he has worked.\nThese comments are from The Baltimore Sun, the cities hiring him and The Cincinnati Enquirer:\nPraise: In Baltimore: a lead architect of the city’s first 10-year financial plan. Oversaw improvements to the city’s bond and debt ratings, according to an announcement of his hiring. In Richmond, Virginia, “led the issuance of numerous municipal bond transactions and implemented a successful city performance management program to improve public accountability and transparency.”\nCriticism: In Richmond, he was described as “the mayor’s pit bull.” In Cincinnati, where he served as city manager, his tenure included accusations of mismanagement, lying, berating employees and retaliating against those who opposed him, as well as warring with other city officials. Five lawsuits were reported to have been filed in Cincinnati alleging Black mistreated and retaliated against city employees.\nOn a 2016 work trip to Denver, Black, the chief of police and two assistant police chiefs went to a strip club and Black asked the city’s female city solicitor to go with them.\nShe declined.\nIf any comparable name comes to mind it would be that of Mark Lewis, who served as Stockton city manager from 2001-2006. Lewis got things done but bruised people along the way.\nDuring his tenure, Stockton Ballpark and Stockton Arena were built, and he pushed renovating downtown Stockton.\nBut those facilities were built with cost overruns. And Lewis unilaterally decided to pay Neil Diamond $1 million for one performance. He was aggressive and secretive and at times embarrassed the council.\nThen-councilman Clem Lee summed it up best on the day Lewis was fired 14 years ago.\n“Mark Lewis was literally the tale of two city managers,” Lee said. “He was the very best we ever had; he was the very worst we ever had.”\nDon’t expect Harry Black to behave like Mark Lewis, Kurt Wilson or any of the other city managers who have served Stockton. But do not be surprised if he eventually behaves in Stockton just as he has in Cincinnati, Baltimore, Richmond or any of the other places where he has worked.\nChoose the plan that's right for you.

      "text": "In this potpourri solo episode I hit on several issues. First, is it fair to draw conclusions about Bernie Sanders and his campaign on the basis of violent, pro-gulag remarks from one of his field coordinators (as recorded by Project Veritas)? Then I review a recent episode on Twitter in which libertarianism was attacked, and one libertarian group responded in the most self-defeating and grotesque way. Finally, I revisit the controversy over “deplatforming,” and respond to libertarians who think they should cheer (“it’s a great free-market outcome!”) when dissident voices are silenced.
